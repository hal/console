"<p>Enterprise beans are server-side application components as defined in the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.1 specification. Enterprise beans are designed for the implementation of application business logic in a decoupled manner to encourage reuse.\n    Enterprise beans are written as Java classes and annotated with the appropriate EJB annotations. They can be deployed to the application server in their own archive (a JAR file) or be deployed as part of a Jakarta EE application. The application server manages the lifecycle of each enterprise bean and provides services to them such as security, transactions, and concurrency management.\n    An enterprise bean can also define any number of business interfaces. Business interfaces provide greater control over which of the bean's methods are available to clients and can also allow access to clients running in remote JVMs.\n    There are three types of Enterprise Bean: Session beans, Message-driven beans and Entity beans.</p>\n\n<h2>Session Beans</h2>\n<p>Session Beans are Enterprise Beans that encapsulate a set of related business processes or tasks and are injected into the classes that request them. There are three types of session bean: stateless, stateful, and singleton.</p>\n\n<h2>Message-Driven Beans</h2>\n<p>Message-driven Beans (MDBs) provide an event driven model for application development. The methods of MDBs are not injected into or invoked from client code but are triggered by the receipt of messages from a messaging service such as a Java Messaging Service (JMS) server. The Jakarta EE specification requires that JMS is supported but other messaging systems can be supported as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Entity Beans</h2>\n<p>Entity beans are now deprecated in EJB 3.1 and it's recommended the use of JPA entities instead.

These caches should not be used directly by user applications.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about Infinispan functionality and configuration options see the\n    <a href=\"http://infinispan.org/docs/5.3.x/index.html\">Infinispan Documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Clustering Modes</h2>\n<p>Clustering can be configured in two different ways in ${build.shortName} using Infinispan. The correct method for your application will depend on your requirements. There is a trade off between availability, consistency, reliability and scalability with each mode. Before choosing a clustering mode, you must identify what are the most important features of your network for you, and balance those requirements.</p>\n\n<h3>Replication Mode</h3>\n<p>Replicated Mode automatically detects and adds new instances on the cluster. Changes made to these instances will be replicated to all nodes on the cluster. Replicated mode typically works best in small clusters because of the amount of information that has to be replicated over the network. Infinispan can be configured to use UDP multicast, which alleviates network traffic congestion to a degree.</p>\n\n<h3>Distribution Mode</h3>\n<p>Distribution mode allows Infinispan to scale the cluster linearly. Distribution mode uses a consistent hash algorithm to determine where in a cluster a new node should be placed. The number of copies of information to be kept is configurable. There is a trade off between the number of copies kept, durability of the data and performance: the more copies that are kept, the more impact on performance, but the less likely you are to lose data in a server failure. The hash algorithm also works to reduce network traffic by locating entries without multicasting or storing metadata.\n</p>\n<p>One should consider using Distribution (dist) mode as a caching strategy when the cluster size exceeds 6-8 nodes. With Distribution mode, data is distributed to only a subset of nodes within the cluster, as opposed to all nodes (default Replicated mode).\n</p>\n\n<h3>Synchronous and Asynchronous Replication</h3>\n<p>Replication can be performed either in synchronous or asynchronous mode, and the mode chosen depends on your requirements and your application. With synchronous replication, the thread that handles the user request is blocked until replication has been successful. Only when the replication is successful, a response is sent back to the client and the thread is released. Synchronous replication has an impact on network traffic because it requires a response from each node in the cluster. It has the advantage, however, of ensuring that all modifications have been made to all nodes in the cluster.</p>\n<p>Asynchronous replication is carried out in the background. Infinispan implements a replication queue, which is used by a background thread to carry out replication. Replication is triggered either on a time basis, or on the queue size. A replication queue allows increased performance because there is no conversation being carried out between the cluster nodes. The trade off with asynchronous replication is that it is not quite so accurate. Failed replication attempts are written to a log, not notified in real time.</p>\n\n<h2>Cache Container</h2>\n<p>A cache container is repository for the caches used by a subsystem. For Infinispan default cache containers are defined in the configuration xml files. One cache is defined as the default cache, which is the cache that will be used for clustering.</p>\n",

"<h2>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis</h2>\n<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is an open source project for an asynchronous messaging system.

This fully replaces the HornetQ broker but retains protocol compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n\nThe core ActiveMQ Artemis is JMS-agnostic and provides a non-JMS API, which is referred to as the core API. ActiveMQ Artemis also provides a JMS client API which uses a facade layer to implement the JMS semantics on top of the core API. Essentially, JMS interactions are translated into core API operations on the client side using the JMS client API. From there, all operations are sent using the core client API and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis wire format. The server itself only uses the core API.

When a node forms a cluster connection to another node, it internally creates a core api connection between itself and the other node.

A connector defines a way in which a client, or other server, can make connections to the server.</p>\n\n<p>The broadcast group takes a set of connectors and broadcasts them on the network. Depending on which broadcasting technique you configure the cluster, it uses either UDP or JGroups to broadcast connector pairs information.</p>\n\n<p>Broadcast groups are defined in the messaging-activemq subsystem of the server configuration. There can be many broadcast groups per ${build.shortName} messaging server.</p>\n\n<h2>Discovery Groups</h2>\n<p>While the broadcast group defines how connector information is broadcasted from a server, a discovery group defines how connector information is received from a broadcast endpoint, for example, a UDP multicast address or JGroup channel.</p>\n\n<p>A discovery group maintains a list of connectors, one for each broadcast by a different server. As it receives broadcasts on the broadcast endpoint from a particular server, it updates its entry in the list for that server. If it has not received a broadcast from a particular server for a length of time it will remove that server’s entry from its list.</p>\n\n<h2>Cluster Connections</h2>\n<p>Cluster connections group servers into clusters so that messages can be load balanced between the nodes of the cluster. Cluster connections are defined in the ${build.shortName} server configuration using the\n    <code>cluster-connection</code> element. There can be zero or more cluster connections defined per ${build.shortName} messaging server.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Grouping Handlers</h2>\n<p>In a cluster, message groups with specific group ids can arrive on any of the nodes. It is important for a node to determine which group ids are bound to which consumer on which node. Each node is responsible for routing message groups correctly to the node which has the consumer processing those group ids, irrespective of where the message groups arrive by default. Once messages with a given group id are sent to a specific consumer connected to the given node in the cluster, then those messages are never sent to another node even if the consumer is disconnected.</p>\n\n<p>This situation is addressed by a grouping handler. Each node has a grouping handler and this grouping handler (along with other handlers) is responsible for routing the message groups to the correct node.</p>\n\n<h2>Core Bridges</h2>\n<p>The function of a api is to consume messages from one destination and forward them to another one, typically on a different ${build.shortName} messaging server.</p>\n\n<p>The source and target servers do not have to be in the same cluster which makes bridging suitable for reliably sending messages from one cluster to another, for instance across a WAN, or internet and where the connection may be unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>The api has built-in resilience to failure so if the target server connection is lost, for example, due to network failure, the api will retry connecting to the target until it comes back online. When it comes back online it will resume operation as normal.</p>\n\n<p>Bridges are a way to reliably connect two separate ${build.shortName} messaging servers together. With a core api both source and target servers must be ${build.shortName} messaging servers.</p>\n",

"<p>Contains the configuration for the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Core Queues</li>\n    <li>JMS Destinations</li>\n    <li>Security Settings</li>\n    <li>Address Settings</li>\n    <li>Diverts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Core Queues</h2>\n<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis core is JMS-agnostic. It does not have any concept of a JMS topic. A JMS topic is implemented in core as an address (the topic name) with zero or more queues bound to it. Each queue bound to that address represents a topic subscription. Likewise, a JMS queue is implemented as an address (the JMS queue name) with one single queue bound to it which represents the JMS queue.</p>\n\n<p>By convention, all JMS queues map to core queues where the core queue name has the string \"jms.queue.\" prepended to it. E.g. the JMS queue with the name \"orders.europe\" would map to the core queue with the name \"jms.queue.orders.europe\". The address at which the core queue is bound is also given by the core queue name.</p>\n\n<p>For JMS topics the address at which the queues that represent the subscriptions are bound is given by prepending the string \"jms.topic.\" to the name of the JMS topic. E.g. the JMS topic with name \"news.europe\" would map to the core address \"jms.topic.news.europe\"</p>\n\n<h2>JMS Destinations</h2>\n<p>JMS destinations, along with JMS connection factories, are JMS administrative objects. Destinations are used by JMS clients for both producing and consuming messages. The destination allows the JMS client to specify the target when it produces messages and the source of messages when consuming messages. When using a publish-subscribe pattern, destinations are referred to as topics. When using a point-to-point pattern, destinations are referred to as queues.</p>\n\n<p>Applications may use many different JMS destinations which are configured on the server side and usually accessed via JNDI.</p>\n\n<h2>Security Settings</h2>\n<p>Security settings are used to configure security around specific destinations. This is done by adding a security constraint using the security-setting configuration element. ${build.shortName} messaging comes with a\n    <code>security-setting</code> configured by default.</p>\n\n<p>The security-setting option makes use of wildcards to handle which destinations to apply the security constraint. The value of a single\n    <code>#</code> patterm will match any address. For more information on using wildcards in security constraints, see\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/7.0/paged/configuring-messaging/chapter-7-configuring-security#role_based_security_for_address\">Role Based Security for Addresses</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Address Settings</h2>\n<p>The messaging-activemq subsystem has several configurable options which control aspects of how and when a message is delivered, how many attempts should be made, and when the message expires. These configuration options all exist within the\n    <code>&lt;address-setting&gt;</code> configuration element. You can have ${build.shortName} apply a single\n    <code>&lt;address-setting&gt;</code> to multiple destinations by using a wildcard syntax.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on using wildcards in address settings, see\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/7.0/paged/configuring-messaging/chapter-6-address-settings\">Wildcard Syntax</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Diverts</h2>\n<p>Diverts are objects configured in ${build.shortName} messaging that help in diverting messages from one address to another. Diverts can be classified into the following types:\n\n<dl>\n    <dt>Exclusive</dt>\n    <dd>A message is only diverted to a new address and never sent to the old address.</dd>\n    <dt>Non-exclusive</dt>\n    <dd>A message is sent the old address, and a copy of it is also sent to the new address. Non-exclusive diverts can be used for splitting the flow of messages.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>A divert will only divert a message to an address on the same server. If you want to divert to an address on a different server, a common pattern would be to divert to a local store-and-forward queue, then set up a api that consumes from that queue and forwards to an address on a different server.</p>",
"<p>High availability is the ability for the system to continue functioning after failure of one or more of the servers.</p>\n\n<p>A part of high availability is failover which is the ability for client connections to migrate from one server to another in event of server failure so client applications can continue to operate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br/> Only persistent message data will survive failover. Any non persistent message data will not be available after failover.</p>\n\n<h2>Live / Backup Pairs</h2>\n<p>${build.shortName} messaging allows servers to be linked together as live - backup pairs where each live server has a backup. Live servers receive messages from clients, while a backup server is not operational until failover occurs. A backup server can be owned by only one live server, and it will remain in passive mode, waiting to take over the live server’s work.</p>\n\n<p>When a live server crashes or is brought down in the correct mode, the backup server currently in passive mode will become the new live server. If the new live server is configured to allow automatic failback, it will detect the old live server coming back up and automatically stop, allowing the old live server to start receiving messages again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br/> If you deploy just one pair of live / backup servers, you cannot effectively use a load balancer in front of the pair because the backup instance is not actively processing messages. Moreover, services such as JNDI and the Undertow web server are not active on the backup server either. For these reasons, deploying JEE applications to an instance of ${build.shortName} being used as a backup messaging server is not supported.</p>\n\n<h2>HA Policies</h2>\n<p>${build.shortName} messaging supports two different strategies for backing up a server: <em>replication</em> and <em>shared store</em>. Each strategy can take the role of a primary or secondary server. Remember that only one HA policy option can be configured per messaging server.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about high availability and the different strategies and policies, see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/7.0/paged/configuring-messaging/chapter-29-high-availability\">High Availability</a>.</p>\n",
"<p>${build.shortName} messaging includes a fully functional JMS message api. The function of a JMS api is to consume messages from a source queue or topic and send them to a target queue or topic, typically on a different server.</p>\n\n<p>The source and target servers do not have to be in the same cluster, which makes bridging suitable for reliably sending messages from one cluster to another, for instance across a WAN, and where the connection may be unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>\n    <strong>Note</strong><br/>Do not confuse a JMS bridge with a core bridge. A JMS bridge can be used to bridge any two JMS 1.1 compliant JMS providers and uses the JMS API. A core bridge is used to bridge any two ${build.shortName} messaging instances and uses the core API. It is preferable to use a core bridge instead of a JMS bridge whenever possible.\n</p>",

"<p>${build.shortName} can be suspended or shut down gracefully. This allows active requests to complete normally, without accepting any new requests. A timeout value specifies how long that the suspend or shut down operation will wait for active requests to complete. While the server is suspended, management requests are still processed.</p>\n<p>Graceful shutdown is coordinated at a server-wide level, mostly focused on the entry points at which a request enters the server. The following subsystems support graceful shutdown:</p>\n<dl>\n    <dt>Undertow</dt>\n    <dd>The <code>undertow</code> subsystem will wait for all requests to finish.</dd>\n    <dt>Modcluster</dt>\n    <dd>The <code>modcluster</code> subsystem will notify the load balancer that the server is suspending in the\n        <code>PRE_SUSPEND</code> phase.\n    </dd>\n    <dt>EJB</dt>\n    <dd>The\n        <code>ejb3</code> subsystem will wait for all remote EJB requests and MDB message deliveries to finish.

If you used RPMs to install ${build.shortName} on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you must use RPM patches.\nImportant.</p>\n\n<p>Before applying or rolling back a patch, you should back up your ${build.shortName} server, including all deployments and configuration files.</p>\n\n<p>Cumulative patches for a ZIP or Installer installation of ${build.shortName} are available to download from the Red Hat Customer Portal.</p>\n\n<p>For multiple ${build.shortName} hosts in a managed domain environment, individual hosts can be patched from your ${build.shortName} domain controller.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to applying a patch, you can also roll back the application of a patch.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Notes on ZIP/Installer Installation Patching</h3>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>If you apply a patch that updates a module, the new patched JARs that are used at runtime are stored in <code>${build.installDir}/modules/system/layers/base/.overlays/PATCH_ID/MODULE</code>. The original unpatched files are left in <code>${build.installDir}/modules/system/layers/base/MODULE</code>, but these JARs are not used at runtime.</li>\n    <li>In order to significantly decrease the size of cumulative patch releases for ${build.shortName}, you now cannot perform a partial roll back of a cumulative patch.

It can also exclude users from roles based on group membership.</p>\n<p>When using the <code>mgmt-users.properties</code> file, group information is stored in the <code>mgmt-groups.properties</code> file. When using LDAP the group information is stored in the LDAP sever and maintained by those responsible for the LDAP server.</p>",
"<p>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a mechanism for specifying a set of permissions for management users. It allows multiple users to share responsibility for managing servers without each of them requiring unrestricted access. By providing \"separation of duties\" for management users, it's easy to spread responsibility between individuals or groups without granting unnecessary privileges. This ensures the maximum possible security of your servers and data while still providing flexibility for configuration, deployment, and management.</p>\n<p>Role-Based Access Control works through a combination of role permissions and constraints. Seven predefined roles are provided that each have different fixed permissions. The predefined roles are: Monitor, Operator, Maintainer, Deployer, Auditor, Administrator, and SuperUser (select a role to get more details about its permissions). Each management user is assigned one or more roles, which specify what the user is permitted to do when managing the server.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Before changing the provider to <code>rbac</code>, be sure your configuration has a user who will be mapped to one of the RBAC roles, preferably with at least one in the Administrator or SuperUser role. Otherwise your installation will not be manageable unless it is shut down and the XML configuration is edited.</p>",
"<h2>Standard Roles</h2>\n<p>There are seven predefined user roles:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Monitor</li>\n    <li>Operator</li>\n    <li>Maintainer</li>\n    <li>Deployer</li>\n    <li>Auditor</li>\n    <li>Administrator</li>\n    <li>SuperUser</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these roles has a different set of permissions and is designed for specific use cases. The Monitor, Operator, Maintainer, Administrator, and SuperUser role each build upon each other, with each having more permissions than the previous. The Auditor and Deployer roles are similar to the Monitor and Maintainer roles respectively but have some additional special permissions and restrictions.</p>\n\n<h2>Scoped Roles</h2>\n<p>Scoped Roles are user-defined roles that grant the permissions of one of the standard roles but only for one or more specified server groups or hosts. Scoped roles allow for management users to be granted permissions that are limited to only those server groups or hosts that are required.</p>\n<p>They are defined by five characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>A unique name.</li>\n    <li>Which of the standard roles it is based on.</li>\n    <li>If it applies to Server Groups or Hosts</li>\n    <li>The list of server groups or hosts that it is restricted to.</li>\n    <li>If all users are automatically include. This defaults to false.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once created a scoped role can be assigned to users and groups the same way that the standard roles are.</p>\n<p>Creating a scoped role does not let you define new permissions. Scoped roles can only be used to apply the permissions of an existing role in a limited scope. For example, you could create a scoped role based on the Deployer role which is restricted to a single server group.</p>\n<p>There are only two scopes that roles can be limited to, host and server group.</p>\n<dl>\n    <dt>Host-scoped roles</dt>\n    <dd>A role that is host-scoped restricts the permissions of that role to one or more hosts. This means access is provided to the relevant /host=*/ resource trees but resources that are specific to other hosts are hidden.</dd>\n    <dt>Server-Group-scoped roles</dt>\n    <dd>A role that is server-group-scoped restricts the permissions of that role to one or more server groups. Additionally the role permissions will also apply to the profile, socket binding group, server config and server resources that are associated with the specified server-groups. Any sub-resources within any of those that are not logically related to the server-group will not be visible to the user.</dd>\n</dl>",
