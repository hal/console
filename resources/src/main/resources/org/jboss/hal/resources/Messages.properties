This behavior is pre-determined and is therefore not configurable when using data replication.

sharedStoreColocated=Colocate live and backup server
sharedStoreMaster=Live server (master)
sharedStoreSlave=Backup server (slave)
sharedStoreStrategy=<strong>Shared Store</strong><br/>This style of high availability differs from data replication in that it requires a shared file system which is accessible by both the live and backup node. This means that the server pairs use the same location for their paging, message journal, bindings journal, and large messages in their configuration.<br/>Also, each participating server in the pair, live and backup, will need to have a <code>cluster-connection</code> defined, even if not part of a cluster, because the <code>cluster-connection</code> defines how the backup server announces its presence to its live server and any other nodes.
